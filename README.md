# TextGenerationWithLSTM

<p>
I've created hopefully easy to understand Text Generation code in jupyter notebook, LSTMs an Word Embedding are used to train the network. If the model reaches good convergance, the generated text will look like the original dataset. Dataset which will be used to be trained uses .txt extension and recommended to have large vocabulary and many words. Feel free to adjust the hyperparameters to reach better convergance
